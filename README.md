# Sum From a to b

## About

This program is a basic example of how to write recursive functions in JavaScript and how to use Mocha and Chai for testing.

The `sum` function in `index.js` takes two integers  and uses recursion to add up all of the numbers in between them.

The `index.js` function runs unit tests on the `sum` function using different values.

## Running the Program

Install the packages using `npm install`.

To run the tests with mocha, type `npm test` in the terminal.

## Notes

Made during Lighthouse Labs (W01D5).
